# candiday (in the life)
React Web App that aims to make learning about voting fun and accessible.

### Creators
Trina Chatterjee, Erika Tan, Nikita Sharma

## Problem Statement
- “Residents 65 years and older are a median of seven times more likely to vote than those ages 18 to 34” (NPR)
- Reasons contributing to lower voter turnout:
  - People don’t see how these political issues affect them
  - People who aren’t that interested in politics don’t want to read numerous sources to learn about the candidate’s policies

## Proposed Solution
- We wanted to make learning about politics interesting and accessible
- Our game not only makes learning more fun but also accumulates information about different candidate’s policies into one place (easy to compare/contrast policies)

## Technologies Used
- React 
  - JSX/HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
- Online photo editors
  - vectr.com
  - pixlr.com
 
 ## Graphics
 All the graphics* for our project were hand made using pixlr.com and vectr.com image and vector online editors

## Further Improvements
- More scenarios, candidates, and a wider range of election issues covered in the game
- Have users input their own information (age, race, gender, income), so we can find specific policies/laws that might affect them
- Use NLP and crawl websites/news articles/etc. instead of researching the candidates’ policies ourselves
