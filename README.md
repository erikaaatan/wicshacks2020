# candiday (in the life)
React Web App that aims to make learning about voting fun and accessible.

## Problem Statement
- “Residents 65 years and older are a median of seven times more likely to vote than those ages 18 to 34” (NPR)
- Reasons contributing to lower voter turnout:
  - People don’t see how these political issues affect them
  - People who aren’t that interested in politics don’t want to read numerous sources to learn about the candidate’s policies

## Proposed Solution
- We wanted to make learning about politics interesting and accessible
- Our game not only makes learning more fun but also accumulates information about different candidate’s policies into one place (easy to compare/contrast policies)

## Technologies Used
- React 
  - JSX/HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
- Online photo editors
  - vectr.com
  - pixlr.com
  
 ## Graphics
 All the graphics* for our project were hand made using pixlr.com and vectr.com image and vector online editors
